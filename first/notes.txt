1)The error you are encountering indicates that you are trying to use TypeScript syntax in a JavaScript environment. The : syntax for type annotations is specific to TypeScript, not JavaScript.

If you want to run this code as TypeScript, you need to make sure it is compiled to JavaScript first. If you are using Node.js, you can set up a TypeScript project and compile your .ts files to .js files. Here's how you can do that:

Initialize a TypeScript project:
npm init -y
npm install typescript --save-dev
npx tsc --init


Write your TypeScript code:
Create a file named index.ts with the following content:
let age: number = 123;
console.log(age);
Compile the TypeScript code:

npx tsc

This will compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript and output it in a .js file (by default in the same directory).
Run the compiled JavaScript code:
node index.js


2)Alternatively, if you want to run your code without compiling, you can use tools like ts-node which allows you to run TypeScript directly:

Install ts-node:
npm install -g ts-node
Run the TypeScript file:

ts-node index.ts
If you want to stick with plain JavaScript and not use TypeScript, you should remove the type annotation:


javascript
let age = 123;
console.log(age);
You can run this code directly with Node.js:
node index.js
